<h2>Brian Huffman</h2>
<!-- Who am I? -->
<p>I am a recent PhD graduate from the
<a HREF="http://www.cs.pdx.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://cs.pdx.edu">Portland State University</a> (previously at the <a href="http://www.ogi.edu">OGI School of
Science &amp; Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.ohsu.edu">OHSU</a>).
I work with the theorem prover
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de">Isabelle</a>.
</p>

<h3>Current Research Interests</h3>

<h4>Domain Theory</h4>
<p>I am currently the maintainer of HOLCF, a library of domain theory for the Isabelle theorem prover.</p>

<p>
My thesis project involves the development of tools for defining
recursive functions and recursive datatypes in HOLCF.  Read more about
it in my <a href="phdthesis.html">PhD thesis</a>.

<h2>My Stuff</h2>
<h3>Isabelle Theories</h3>

A few of my Isabelle theories are published online at the <a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net">Archive of Formal Proofs</a>.

  <dt>
    <a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Tycon.shtml">
      Type Constructor Classes and Monad Transformers
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    June 2012. These theories contain a formalization of first class type constructors and axiomatic constructor classes for HOLCF. This work is described in detail in the ICFP 2012 paper Formal Verification of Monad Transformers by the author. The formalization is a revised and updated version of earlier joint work with Matthews and White. Based on the hierarchy of type classes in Haskell, we define classes for functors, monads, monad-plus, etc. Each one includes all the standard laws as axioms. We also provide a new user command, tycondef, for defining new type constructors in HOLCF. Using tycondef, we instantiate the type class hierarchy with various monads and monad transformers.

  <dt>
    <a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Free-Boolean-Algebra.shtml">
      Free Boolean Algebra
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    March 2010. This theory defines a type constructor representing the free boolean algebra over a set of generators. Values of type (&alpha;)<i>formula</i> represent propositional formulas with uninterpreted variables from type &alpha;, ordered by implication. In addition to all the standard boolean algebra operations, the library also provides a function for building homomorphisms to any other boolean algebra type.

  <dt>
    <a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Stream-Fusion.shtml">
      Stream Fusion
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    April 2009. Stream Fusion is a system for removing intermediate list structures from Haskell programs; it consists of a Haskell library along with several compiler rewrite rules. (The library is available <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/streams.html">online</a>.) These theories contain a formalization of much of the Stream Fusion library in HOLCF. Lazy list and stream types are defined, along with coercions between the two types, as well as an equivalence relation for streams that generate the same list. List and stream versions of map, filter, foldr, enumFromTo, append, zipWith, and concatMap are defined, and the stream versions are shown to respect stream equivalence.

  <dt>
    <a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Ordinal.shtml">
      Countable Ordinals
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    November 2005. This development defines a well-ordered type of countable ordinals. It includes notions of continuous and normal functions, recursively defined functions over ordinals, least fixed-points, and derivatives. Much of ordinal arithmetic is formalized, including exponentials and logarithms. The development concludes with formalizations of Cantor Normal Form and Veblen hierarchies over normal functions.
