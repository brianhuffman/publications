  abstract = {Parametric polymorphism constrains the behavior of pure functional
            programs in a way that allows the derivation of interesting theorems
            about them solely from their types, i.e., virtually for free.
            Unfortunately, standard parametricity results --- including so-called
            free theorems --- fail for nonstrict languages supporting a polymorphic
            strict evaluation primitive such as Haskell's $\mathit{seq}$. A folk theorem
            maintains that such results hold for a subset of Haskell corresponding
            to a Girard-Reynolds calculus with fixpoints and algebraic datatypes
            \textit{even when $\mathit{seq}$ is present} provided the relations which appear
            in their derivations are required to be bottom-reflecting and
            admissible. In this paper we show that this folklore is incorrect, but
            that parametricity results \textit{can} be recovered in the presence of
            $\mathit{seq}$ by restricting attention to left-closed, total, and admissible
            relations instead. The key novelty of our approach is the asymmetry
            introduced by left-closedness, which leads to ``inequational'' versions
            of standard parametricity results together with preconditions
            guaranteeing their validity even when $\mathit{seq}$ is present. We use these
            results to derive criteria ensuring that both equational and 
            inequational versions of short cut fusion and related program
            transformations based on free theorems hold in the presence of $\mathit{seq}$.},
